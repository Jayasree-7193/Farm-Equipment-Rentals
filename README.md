# Farm-Equipment-Rentals

Agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for about 58% of India&#39;s
population. People in rural areas depend on agriculture for their livelihood. They may
include farmers, daily laborers, lessors, etc. Poor farmers struggle to buy machinery in
fear of huge debt and the cost of equipment. Without machinery, it would be
impossible to carry out farming. Not only farmers, but any individual who is
interested in farming may not have the budget to buy all the farm equipment.

A lessor who is ready to offer the machinery for rent is not aware of
these farmers, start-ups who are not nearby but need Farm machinery. Lessors usually
communicate through mobile with people who need their equipment. As it is a manual
process, it would be hard for farmers to know about the rent and what type of
equipment is available at uneven times when the lessor is busy. People who meet
lessors personally get disappointed when they find their desired equipment is not
available besides journey, and time.

The Farm Equipment Rental System is a user-friendly website
available 24/7. The main objectives of the system are to help the farmer for buying
equipment for rent on an hour or daily basis, and for the lessor to display his
machinery for rent irrespective of his busy schedule. An individual who wants to do
farming and needs farming equipment can use this website and apply for machinery.
It is so simple that no specific skill is required to operate this website. As per these
concerns, the website is designed.

1. It manages all the information about user and admin regarding their bookings
   and returnings.
2. It is simpler to create an account for the user and it doesnt require any special
   skills regarding computer or mobile.
3. A user can add required tools for cart and book them whenever he/she needed.
4. The main objective of this project is to build an application program which
   reduce manual work for both rental service owner and farmer to maintain
   bookings and returnings.
